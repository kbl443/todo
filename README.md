# Welcome


## Project Structure

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with your project structure:

- `frontend/`: Contains your frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript)
- `main.go`: The entry point of your Go backend


## Next Steps

1. Modify the frontend in the `frontend/` directory to create your desired UI.
2. Add backend functionality in `main.go`.
3. Use `wails3 dev` to see your changes in real-time.
4. When ready, build your application with `wails3 build`.

Happy coding with Wails3! If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to consult the documentation or reach out to the Wails community.
